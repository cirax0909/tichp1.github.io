		  <div class="span5">
          <p>To really understand big data, it’s helpful to have some historical background. 
		  Here is Gartner’s definition, circa 2001 (which is still the go-to definition): 
		  Big data is data that contains greater variety arriving in increasing volumes and with ever-higher velocity. 
		  This is known as the three Vs.</p>
		  <div class="row space10"></div>
          <p>Put simply, big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources. 
		  These data sets are so voluminous that traditional data processing software just can’t manage them. 
		  But these massive volumes of data can be used to address business problems you wouldn’t have been able to tackle before.</p>

                      The amount of data matters. With big data, you’ll have to process high volumes of low-density, unstructured data. 
					  This can be data of unknown value, such as Twitter data feeds, clickstreams on a webpage or a mobile app, or sensor-enabled equipment. 
					  For some organizations, this might be tens of terabytes of data. For others, it may be hundreds of petabytes.

                      Velocity is the fast rate at which data is received and (perhaps) acted on. 
					  Normally, the highest velocity of data streams directly into memory versus being written to disk. 
					  Some internet-enabled smart products operate in real time or near real time and will require real-time evaluation and action.

					  Traditional data types were structured and fit neatly in a relational database.

					  Unstructured and semistructured data types, such as text, audio, and video, require additional preprocessing to derive meaning and support metadata.

                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Product development</th>
                    <td>Companies like Netflix and Procter & Gamble use big data to anticipate customer demand. 
					They build predictive models for new products and services by classifying key attributes of past and current products or services and modeling the relationship between those attributes and the commercial success of the offerings. 
					In addition, P&G uses data and analytics from focus groups, social media, test markets, and early store rollouts to plan, produce, and launch new products.</td>
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>

                    <td>Predictive maintenance</td>
                    <th>Factors that can predict mechanical failures may be deeply buried in structured data, such as the year, make, and model of equipment, 
					as well as in unstructured data that covers millions of log entries, sensor data, error messages, and engine temperature. 
					By analyzing these indications of potential issues before the problems happen, organizations can deploy maintenance more cost effectively 
					and maximize parts and equipment uptime.</th>

                    <td>The race for customers is on. A clearer view of customer experience is more possible now than ever before. 
					Big data enables you to gather data from social media, web visits, call logs, and other sources to improve the interaction experience and maximize

              <h3>How big data works</h3>
			  <p>Big data gives you new insights that open up new opportunities and business models. Getting started involves three key actions:<p>
              <ul class="list-a">
                <li><strong>Integrate</strong></li>
				<p>Big data brings together data from many disparate sources and applications. 
				Traditional data integration mechanisms, such as ETL (extract, transform, and load) generally aren’t up to the task. 
				It requires new strategies and technologies to analyze big data sets at terabyte, or even petabyte, scale.</p>
				<p>During integration, you need to bring in the data, process it, and make sure it’s formatted and available in a form that your business analysts can get started with.</p>
                <li><strong>Manage</strong></li>
				<p>Big data requires storage. Your storage solution can be in the cloud, on premises, or both. 
				You can store your data in any form you want and bring your desired processing requirements and necessary process engines to those data sets on an on-demand basis. 
				Many people choose their storage solution according to where their data is currently residing. 
				The cloud is gradually gaining popularity because it supports your current compute requirements and enables you to spin up resources as needed.</p>
                <li><strong>Analyze</strong></li>
				<p>Your investment in big data pays off when you analyze and act on your data. Get new clarity with a visual analysis of your varied data sets. 
				Explore the data further to make new discoveries. Share your findings with others. Build data models with machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
				Put your data to work.</p>
