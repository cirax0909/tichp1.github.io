          <h2>What is data analytics?</h2>
		  
          <p>Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data in order to make conclusions about that information. 
		  Many of the techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms 
		  that work over raw data for human consumption.</p>

		<p>Data analytics techniques can reveal trends and metrics that would otherwise be lost in the mass of information. 
		This information can then be used to optimize processes to increase the overall efficiency of a business or system.</p>  

          <h3>Understanding Data Analytics</h3>
		  
          <div class="ic-1"></div>
         <img src="img/data-analytics.png" alt="">
		  <p>Data analytics can do much more than point out bottlenecks in production. 
		  Gaming companies use data analytics to set reward schedules for players that keep the majority of players 
		  active in the game. Content companies use many of the same data analytics to keep you clicking, watching, 
		  or re-organizing content to get another view or another click. 
		  The process involved in data analysis involves several different steps:</p>
		 
            <dl class="list-b">
              <!-- List Items -->
              <dt>Classify</dt>
			  <dd>The first step is to determine the data requirements or how the data is grouped. 
			  Data may be separated by age, demographic, income, or gender. 
			  Data values may be numerical or be divided by category.</dd>
			  <div class="row space20"></div>
              <dt>Process</dt>
			  <dd>The second step in data analytics is the process of collecting it. 
			  This can be done through a variety of sources such as computers, online sources, cameras, environmental sources, 
			  or through personnel.</dd>
			  <div class="row space20"></div>
              <dt>Organize</dt>
			  <dd>Once the data is collected, it must be organized so it can be analyzed. 
			  Organization may take place on a spreadsheet or other form of software that can take statistical data.</dd>
			  <div class="row space20"></div>
              <dt>Clean up</dt>
			  <dd>The data is then cleaned up before analysis. This means it is scrubbed and checked to ensure there is 
			  no duplication or error, and that it is not incomplete. This step helps correct any errors before it goes on 
			  to a data analyst to be analyzed.</dd>

				<p>Data analysts exist at the intersection of information technology, statistics and business. 
				They combine these fields in order to help businesses and organizations succeed. 
				The primary goal of a data analyst is to increase efficiency and improve performance by discovering patterns 
				in data.</p>
                <p>The work of a data analyst involves working with data throughout the data analysis pipeline. 
				This means working with data in various ways. The primary steps in the data analytics process are data mining, 
				data management, statistical analysis, and data presentation. The importance and balance of these steps depend on the data being used and the goal of the analysis.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane" id="tab2">
                
				<p>Data management or data warehousing is another key aspect of a data analyst’s job. 
				Data warehousing involves designing and implementing databases that allow easy access to the results of data mining. 
				This step generally involves creating and managing SQL databases. 
				Non-relational and NoSQL databases are becoming more common as well.</p>
                <p>Data mining is an essential process for many data analytics tasks. 
				This involves extracting data from unstructured data sources. These may include written text, 
				large complex databases, or raw sensor data. The key steps in this process are to extract, transform, 
				and load data (often called ETL.) These steps convert raw data into a useful and manageable format. 
				This prepares data for storage and analysis. Data mining is generally the most time-intensive step in 
				the data analysis pipeline.</p>

              <div class="tab-pane" id="tab3">
                
                <p>Statistical analysis allows analysts to create insights from data. 
				Both statistics and machine learning techniques are used to analyze data. 
				Big data is used to create statistical models that reveal trends in data. 
				These models can then be applied to new data to make predictions and inform decision making. 
				Statistical programming languages such as R or Python (with pandas) are essential to this process. 
				In addition, open source libraries and packages such as TensorFlow enable advanced analysis.</p>
              </div>
			  <div class="tab-pane" id="tab4">
                
                <p>The final step in most data analytics processes is data presentation. 
				This step allows insights to be shared with stakeholders. 
				Data visualization is often the most important tool in data presentation. 
				Compelling visualizations can help tell the story in the data which may help executives and managers 
				understand the importance of these insights.</p>
