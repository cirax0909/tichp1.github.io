          <h2>What is business intelligence?</h2>
          <p>Business intelligence (BI) leverages software and services to transform data into actionable insights that inform an organization’s strategic and tactical business 
		  decisions. BI tools access and analyze data sets and present analytical findings in reports, summaries, dashboards, graphs, charts and maps to provide users with 
		  detailed intelligence about the state of the business.</p>

			<p>The term business intelligence often also refers to a range of tools that provide quick, easy-to-digest access to insights about an organization's current state, 
			based on available data.</p>
			
          <h3>Business intelligence examples</h3>
		  <p>Reporting is a central facet of business intelligence and the dashboard is perhaps the archetypical BI tool. Dashboards are hosted software applications that 
		  automatically pull together available data into charts and graphs that give a sense of the immediate state of the company.</p>
		  <p>The potential use cases for BI extend beyond the typical business performance metrics of improved sales and reduced costs, says Cindi Howson, 
		  research vice president at Gartner, an IT research and advisory firm. She points to the Columbus, Ohio, school system and its success using BI tools to examine 
		  numerous data points — from attendance rates to student performance — to improve student learning and high school graduate rates.</p>

		  <p> 
            Of these tools, SelectHub says the dashboards and visualization are by far the most popular; 
			they offer the quick and easy-to-digest data summaries that are at the heart of BI's value proposition.</p>
			
		<h3>Business intelligence analyst</h3>
		  <p>Any company that's serious about BI will need to have business intelligence analysts on staff. CIO.com has an in-depth article on what that job entails; 
		  in general, they aim to use all the features of BI tools to get the data that companies need, the most important being discovering areas of revenue loss and 
		  identifying where improvements can be made to save the company money or increase profits.</p>
		  <p>Even if your company relies on self-service BI tools on a day-to-day basis, business intelligence analysts have an important role to play, as they are necessary for managing and 
		  maintaining those tools and their vendors. They also set up and standardize the reports that managers are going to be generating to make sure that results are consistent and 
		  meaningful across your organization. And to avoid garbage in/garbage out problems, business intelligence analysts need to make sure the data going into the system is correct and 
		  consistent, which often involves getting it out of other data stores and cleaning it up.</p>
