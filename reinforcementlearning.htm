          <h2>What is reinforcement learning?</h2>
		<img src="img/AI.jpeg" alt="">
          <p>Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, 
		  potentially complex environment. In reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence faces a game-like situation. The computer employs trial and error to come up with 
		  a solution to the problem. To get the machine to do what the programmer wants, the artificial intelligence gets either rewards or penalties for the actions it performs. 
		  Its goal is to maximize the total reward. Although the designer sets the reward policy–that is, the rules of the game–he gives the model no hints or suggestions for 
		  how to solve the game. It’s up to the model to figure out how to perform the task to maximize the reward, starting from totally random trials and finishing with 
		  sophisticated tactics and superhuman skills. By leveraging the power of search and many trials, reinforcement learning is currently the most effective way to hint 
		  machine’s creativity. In contrast to human beings, artificial intelligence can gather experience from thousands of parallel gameplays if a reinforcement learning 
		  algorithm is run on a sufficiently powerful computer infrastructure.</p>
			
          <h3>Examples of reinforcement learning</h3>
		  <p>Applications of reinforcement learning were in the past limited by weak computer infrastructure. However, as Gerard Tesauro’s backgamon AI superplayer developed 
		  in 1990’s shows, progress did happen. That early progress is now rapidly changing with powerful new computational technologies opening the way to completely new inspiring 
		  applications. Training the models that control autonomous cars is an excellent example of a potential application of reinforcement learning. In an ideal situation, 
		  the computer should get no instructions on driving the car. The programmer would avoid hard-wiring anything connected with the task and allow the machine to learn 
		  from its own errors. In a perfect situation, the only hard-wired element would be the reward function.</p>

			  <li>For example, in usual circumstances we would require an autonomous vehicle to put safety first, minimize ride time, reduce pollution, 
			  offer passengers comfort and obey the rules of law. With an autonomous race car, on the other hand, we would emphasize speed much more than the driver’s comfort. 
			  The programmer cannot predict everything that could happen on the road. Instead of building lengthy “if-then” instructions, the programmer prepares the reinforcement 
			  learning agent to be capable of learning from the system of rewards and penalties. The agent (another name for reinforcement learning algorithms performing the task) 
			  gets rewards for reaching specific goals.</li>
			  <div class="row space20"></div>
              
			  <li>Another example: deepsense.ai took part in the “Learning to run” project, which aimed to train a virtual runner from scratch. 
			  The runner is an advanced and precise musculoskeletal model designed by the Stanford Neuromuscular Biomechanics Laboratory. Learning the agent how to run is 
			  a first step in building a new generation of prosthetic legs, ones that automatically recognize people’s walking patterns and tweak themselves to make moving easier 
			  and more effective. While it is possible and has been done in Stanford’s labs, hard-wiring all the commands and predicting all possible patterns of walking requires 
			  a lot of work from highly skilled programmers.</li>

      <h3>What distinguishes reinforcement learning from deep learning and machine learning?</h3>

		  <p>In fact, there should be no clear divide between machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning. It is like a parallelogram – rectangle – square relation, 
		  where machine learning is the broadest category and the deep reinforcement learning the most narrow one. In the same way, reinforcement learning is a specialized 
		  application of machine and deep learning techniques, designed to solve problems in a particular way.</p>
		  <p>Although the ideas seem to differ, there is no sharp divide between these subtypes. Moreover, they merge within projects, as the models are designed not to stick to 
		  a “pure type” but to perform the task in the most effective way possible. So “what precisely distinguishes machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning” is 
		  actually a tricky question to answer.</p>
		  <p><strong>Machine learning</strong> – is a form of AI in which computers are given the ability to progressively improve the performance of a specific task with data, 
		  without being directly programmed ( this is Arthur Lee Samuel’s definition. He coined the term “machine learning”, of which there are two types, supervised 
		  and unsupervised machine learning</p>

        </div>
		  <p> 
            From the AI point of view, a single model was performing a single task on a clarified and normalized dataset. To get more details on the story, read our blog post. Unsupervised learning takes place when the model is provided only with the input data, but no explicit labels. It has to dig through the data and find the hidden structure 
			or relationships within. The designer might not know what the structure is or what the machine learning model is going to find.  
          </p>
		  <p>An example we employed was for churn prediction. We analyzed customer data and designed an algorithm to group similar customers. However, 
		  we didn’t choose the groups ourselves. Later on, we could identify high-risk groups (those with a high churn rate) and our client knew which customers they should 
		  approach first.</p>
		  <p><strong>Deep learning</strong> consists of several layers of neural networks, designed to perform more sophisticated tasks. The construction of deep learning models was 
		  inspired by the design of the human brain, but simplified. Deep learning models consist of a few neural network layers which are in principle responsible for gradually 
		  learning more abstract features about particular data.</p>
		  <p>Example: deepsense.ai designed a deep learning-based model for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It was designed to recognize Right whales 
		  from aerial photos taken by researchers. For further information about this endangered species and deepsense.ai’s work with the NOAA, read our blog post. 
		  From a technical point of view, recognizing a particular specimen of whales from aerial photos is pure deep learning. The solution consists of a few machine 
		  learning models performing separate tasks. The first one was in charge of finding the head of the whale in the photograph while the second normalized the photo by 
		  cutting and turning it, which ultimately provided a unified view (a passport photo) of a single whale.</p>

		  <p>Reinforcement learning, as stated above employs a system of rewards and penalties to compel the computer to solve a problem by itself. 
		  Human involvement is limited to changing the environment and tweaking the system of rewards and penalties. As the computer maximizes the reward, 
		  it is prone to seeking unexpected ways of doing it. Human involvement is focused on preventing it from exploiting the system and motivating the machine to perform 
		  the task in the way expected. Reinforcement learning is useful when there is no “proper way” to perform a task, yet there are rules the model has to follow to perform 
		  its duties correctly. Take the road code, for example.</p>
		  <p>Example: By tweaking and seeking the optimal policy for deep reinforcement learning, we built an agent that in just 20 minutes reached a superhuman level in playing 
		  Atari games. Similar algorithms in principal can be used to build AI for an autonomous car or a prosthetic leg. In fact, one of the best ways to evaluate the 
		  reinforcement learning approach is to give the model an Atari video game to play, such as Arkanoid or Space Invaders. According to Google Brain’s Marc G. Bellemare, 
		  who introduced Atari video games as a reinforcement learning benchmark, “although challenging, these environments remain simple enough that we can hope to achieve
		  measurable progress as we attempt to solve them”.</p>

		  <h3>What distinguishes reinforcement learning from deep learning and machine learning?</h3>
		  <p>Although reinforcement learning, deep learning, and machine learning are interconnected no one of them in particular is going to replace the others. 
		  Yann LeCun, the renowned French scientist and head of research at Facebook, jokes that reinforcement learning is the cherry on a great AI cake with machine learning the 
		  cake itself and deep learning the icing. Without the previous iterations, the cherry would top nothing.In many use cases, using classical machine learning methods will 
		  suffice. Purely algorithmic methods not involving machine learning tend to be useful in business data processing or managing databases.</p>
		  <p>Sometimes machine learning is only supporting a process being performed in another way, for example by seeking a way to optimize speed or efficiency.
		When a machine has to deal with unstructured and unsorted data, or with various types of data, neural networks can be very useful. 
		How machine learning improved the quality of machine translation has been described by The New York Times.</p>
