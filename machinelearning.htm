          <h2>What is machine learning?</h2>
          <p>At a very high level, machine learning is the process of teaching a computer system how to make accurate predictions when fed data.</p>

			<p>Those predictions could be answering whether a piece of fruit in a photo is a banana or an apple, spotting people crossing the road in front of a self-driving car, 
			whether the use of the word book in a sentence relates to a paperback or a hotel reservation, whether an email is spam, or recognizing speech accurately enough to generate 
			captions for a YouTube video.</p> 
		
			<p>The key difference from traditional computer software is that a human developer hasn't written code that instructs the system how to tell the difference 
			between the banana and the apple. Instead a machine-learning model has been taught how to reliably discriminate between the fruits by being trained on 
			a large amount of data, in this instance likely a huge number of images labelled as containing a banana or an apple.</p>
			
          <h3>Why is machine learning important?</h3>
		  <p>Resurging interest in machine learning is due to the same factors that have made data mining and Bayesian analysis more popular than ever. 
		  Things like growing volumes and varieties of available data, computational processing that is cheaper and more powerful, and affordable data storage</p>
		  <p>All of these things mean it's possible to quickly and automatically produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, 
		  more accurate results – even on a very large scale. And by building precise models, an organization has a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities – 
		  or avoiding unknown risks.</p>

		<h3>What are neural networks and how are they trained?</h3>
		<img src="img/machine2.jpeg" alt="">
		<div class="row space20"></div>
		  <p> 
            A very important group of algorithms for both supervised and unsupervised machine learning are neural networks. These underlie much of machine learning, and while simple models like linear regression used can be used to make predictions based on a small number of data features, as in the Google example with beer and wine, neural networks are useful when dealing with large sets of data with many features.    
          </p>
		  <p>Neural networks, whose structure is loosely inspired by that of the brain, are interconnected layers of algorithms, called neurons, which feed data into each other, with the output of the preceding layer being the input of the subsequent layer.</p>
		  <p>Each layer can be thought of as recognizing different features of the overall data. 
		  For instance, consider the example of using machine learning to recognize handwritten numbers between 0 and 9. 
		  The first layer in the neural network might measure the color of the individual pixels in the image, the second layer could spot shapes, 
		  such as lines and curves, the next layer might look for larger components of the written number -- for example, the rounded loop at the base of the number 6. 
		  This carries on all the way through to the final layer, which will output the probability that a given handwritten figure is a number between 0 and 9.</p>
		  <p>The network learns how to recognize each component of the numbers during the training process, by gradually tweaking the importance of data as it flows between the layers of the network. This is possible due to each link between layers having an attached weight, whose value can be increased or decreased to alter that link's significance. At the end of each training cycle the system will examine whether the neural network's final output is getting closer or further away from what is desired -- for instance is the network getting better or worse at identifying a handwritten number 6. To close the gap between between the actual output and desired output, the system will then work backwards through the neural network, altering the weights attached to all of these links between layers, as well as an associated value called bias. This process is called back-propagation.</p>
		  <p>Eventually this process will settle on values for these weights and biases that will allow the network to reliably perform a given task, 
		  such as recognizing handwritten numbers, and the network can be said to have "learned" how to carry out a specific task.</p>
