          <h2>What is Deep Learning?</h2>
          <p>Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. 
		  If you are just starting out in the field of deep learning or you had some experience with neural networks some time ago, you may be confused. I know I was confused 
		  initially and so were many of my colleagues and friends who learned and used neural networks in the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>

			<p>In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound. 
			Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes exceeding human-level performance. Models are trained by using a large set of 
			labeled data and neural network architectures that contain many layers.</p> 
		
          <h3>Why Deep Learning Matters</h3>
		  <p>While deep learning was first theorized in the 1980s, there are two main reasons it has only recently become useful:</p>
		  <ol>
              
			  <li>Deep learning requires large amounts of labeled data. For example, driverless car development requires millions of images and thousands of hours of video.</li>
			  <div class="row space20"></div>
              
			  <li>Deep learning requires substantial computing power. High-performance GPUs have a parallel architecture that is efficient for deep learning. 
			  When combined with clusters or cloud computing, this enables development teams to reduce training time for a deep learning network from weeks to hours or less.</li>
			  <div class="row space20"></div>
              
            </ol>
		  <p>All of these things mean it's possible to quickly and automatically produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, 
		  more accurate results – even on a very large scale. And by building precise models, an organization has a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities – 
		  or avoiding unknown risks.</p>

      <h3>Examples of Deep Learning at Work</h3>

		  <p>Deep learning applications are used in industries from automated driving to medical devices.</p>
		  <p>Automated Driving: Automotive researchers are using deep learning to automatically detect objects such as stop signs and traffic lights. 
		In addition, deep learning is used to detect pedestrians, which helps decrease accidents.</p>
		<p>Aerospace and Defense: Deep learning is used to identify objects from satellites 
		that locate areas of interest, and identify safe or unsafe zones for troops.</p>
		<p>Medical Research: Cancer researchers are using deep learning to automatically detect cancer cells. Teams at UCLA built an advanced microscope that yields 
		a high-dimensional data set used to train a deep learning application to accurately identify cancer cells.</p>

		<p>Industrial Automation: Deep learning is helping to improve worker safety around heavy machinery by automatically detecting when people or objects are within 
		an unsafe distance of machines.</p>
		<p>Electronics: Deep learning is being used in automated hearing and speech translation. For example, home assistance devices that respond to your voice and 
		know your preferences are powered by deep learning applications.</p>

		<h3>How Deep Learning Works</h3>

		<img src="img/aboutdeep.png" alt="">
		  <p> 
            Most deep learning methods use neural network architectures, which is why deep learning models are often referred to as deep neural networks. 
			The term “deep” usually refers to the number of hidden layers in the neural network. Traditional neural networks only contain 2-3 hidden layers,
			while deep networks can have as many as 150.
          </p>
		  <p>Deep learning models are trained by using large sets of labeled data and neural network architectures that learn features directly from 
		  the data without the need for manual feature extraction.</p>
		  <div class="space20"></div> 
		<img src="img/deelearning2.jpeg" alt="">
		<div class="space20"></div> 
		  <p>One of the most popular types of deep neural networks is known as convolutional neural networks (CNN or ConvNet). A CNN convolves learned features with input data, 
		  and uses 2D convolutional layers, making this architecture well suited to processing 2D data, such as images.</p>
		  <p>CNNs eliminate the need for manual feature extraction, so you do not need to identify features used to classify images. The CNN works by extracting features 
		  directly from images. The relevant features are not pretrained; they are learned while the network trains on a collection of images. 
		  This automated feature extraction makes deep learning models highly accurate for computer vision tasks such as object classification.</p>
		  <div class="space20"></div> 
		  <img src="img/deep1.jpeg" alt="">
		  <div class="space20"></div> 
		  <p>CNNs learn to detect different features of an image using tens or hundreds of hidden layers. Every hidden layer increases the complexity of the learned image 
		  features. For example, the first hidden layer could learn how to detect edges, and the last learns how to detect more complex shapes specifically 
		  catered to the shape of the object we are trying to recognize.</p>
